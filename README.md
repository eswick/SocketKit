# SocketKit

SocketKit is a cross-platform, pure-Swift library for interfacing with network sockets.

Each protocol consists of a `Client` and a `Listener`, which can be used to initiate connections.

Currently, only TCP is supported.

SocketKit depends on [StreamKit](https://github.com/eswick/StreamKit).

## Building
